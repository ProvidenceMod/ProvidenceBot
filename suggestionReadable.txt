a zombie that died underwater and has barnacles and coral all over them. can survive the deep because magic. might be nice if they dropped coral, so you didn't need to constantly grow it for gills potions.

Goblin Shark | <@246089579982094337> | 30 - 04 - 2021 | 113
It's a Goblin shark, suprisingly

Blobfish | <@246089579982094337> | 30 - 04 - 2021 | 114
Essentially an underwater slime, due to their slimey nature

Vampire Squid | <@246089579982094337> | 30 - 04 - 2021 | 115
sucks a minor amount of life and heals itself? probably wouldn't be too damaging, as we'd want it to be decently common. maybe they only come out at night.

Megalodon | <@246089579982094337> | 30 - 04 - 2021 | 116
Shark that comes out during a rain or something when you're in the open ocean, kinda like a miniboss. in the same vein as desert gaurdians or ice golems

Sky Scraper | <@117819195432894466> | 01 - 05 - 2021 | 117
Working name... anyways, a late-game 'sword' that uses the animation of the drill... as in, hold down the button to have it point towards the cursor and it damages people it comes in contact with.  But, while holding it out, it jets you in that direction.  Think of flying around while holding onto the tail end of a rocket, knocking people aside when you stab through them.  Late-game because it's basically unlimited flight, even though it's very awkward controls

Weapon Skins | <@117819195432894466> | 01 - 05 - 2021 | 118
Something like... a cosmetic slot that substitutes what is in your hands when you attack.  Maybe slots for melee, ranged, and cast...?  Might be too much to separate the different types.  Would be hilarious swinging a gun to smack badguys

Turrets | <@246089579982094337> | 03 - 05 - 2021 | 119
turrets of varying sorts, Gun turrets, rocket turrets, magic turrets? would a better incentive for protecting and guarding your base, making it more of a stronghold, and a safe location, as opposed to somewhere you visit briefly to craft things. would also be helpful during events. Ideas include liming amounts withing a certain tile radius. maybe having the rocket turret shoot drilling rockets, to hit enemies that move through tile surfaces

The Archangels Wrath | <@246089579982094337> | 03 - 05 - 2021 | 120
basically you build a multiblock structure on the moon {idea pending, we don't know if we can do that} with your base, although you can do it anywhere, this would just further insentivize base building. its a late game non-magic weapon that can only be used at night, and not during a new moon, that focuses sunlight down on a target, like a downward facing last prism, as an example. it would be hard to make, but the upside, is it doesn't use mana, and is basically infinite use during the night. we can have it's power level be based on the lunar phase, as less light would be prevalent when the moon is nearing a new moon, than when it's nearing a full moon.

Crystal Pistol | <@402246856752627713> | 09 - 05 - 2021 | 121
A ranged weapon that shoots crystal darts which when impacting a target explode into crystal shards that home in on the target that was hit. A better version of crystal bullets, unique to this weapon

Bullets made of Brimstone Crystals. They repeat the AI of Crystal Bullets, but they inflict Hellfire on their target

hammer of the earth | <@246089579982094337> | 10 - 05 - 2021 | 124
a hammer, that is an actual melee weapon instead if a furteture interaction item that has a powerful, but slow left click with a ton of knockback. when you right click you slam the hammer into the ground, sending out rocky bursts to hit nearby enemies

Prismatic Spray Shotgun | <@402246856752627713> | 10 - 05 - 2021 | 125
Shoots 6 pellets of light that represent each element, each inflicting their own debuff. On contact with an enemy, they shoot out sparks of that element which damage any enemy they come into contact with
